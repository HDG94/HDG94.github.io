    During my PhD at the University of Oxford, I have been a teaching assistant (TA) for the course <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2020-2021/cgt/">Computational Game Theory</a> taught by Prof. Michael Wooldridge and Prof. Edith Elkind. The course include key models and solution concepts of non-cooperative and cooperative game theory; and issues that arise when computing with game theoretic solution concepts, and the main approaches to overcoming these issues.
