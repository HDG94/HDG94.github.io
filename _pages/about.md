I am a `PhD (thesis defended) in Computer Science at the University of Oxford` supervised by `Prof. Michael Wooldridge` and `Prof. Alex Rogers`. My research interests include `Game Theory`, `Multiagent RL` (reinforcement learning) and `hierarchical RL`. In particular, my thesis studies Game-theoretic payoff allocation in multiagent machine learning systems.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained an `MSc in Computer Science` (Graduated with Distinction, 2016) from the University of Oxford, where my thesis studied efficient computation of Nash equilibria in Weighted Boolean Games. I obtained a `BSc in Physics` with a Minor Degree in IT (First class honours, 2015) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was an `exchange student` at EPFL (Spring 2014).

During my PhD, I was a `Research Intern` at `Microsoft Research Cambridge` (Summer 2019) where I was supervised by `Dr. Sebastian Tschiatschek`. I was a Machine Learning Intern at `Apple Siri Cambridge` (Summer 2017) where I was supervised by `Dr. Thomas Voice`.
