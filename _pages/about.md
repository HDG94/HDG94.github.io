I am a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/">Prof. Michael Wooldridge </a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alex.rogers/">Prof. Alex Rogers </a>. My research interests include **Game Theory**, **Multiagent Reinforcement Learning** and **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**. In particular, my thesis studies Game-theoretic Payoff Allocation in Multiagent Machine Learning Systems.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained an **MSc in Computer Science** (Graduated with Distinction, 2016) from the University of Oxford, where my thesis studied Efficient Computation of Nash equilibria in Weighted Boolean Games. I obtained a **BSc in Physics** with a Minor Degree in IT (First class honours, 2015) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was an exchange student at EPFL (Spring 2014).

During my PhD, I was a **Research Intern** at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge </a> (Summer 2019) where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.tschiatschek.net/">Dr. Sebastian Tschiatschek</a>. I was a **Machine Learning Intern** at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/siri/">Apple Siri Cambridge</a> (Summer 2017) where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-voice-a67b9ab9/">Dr. Thomas Voice</a>.
