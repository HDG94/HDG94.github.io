**Overview:** During my PhD, I was a **Machine Learning Research Intern** at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge </a> (Summer 2019) where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.tschiatschek.net/">Dr. Sebastian Tschiatschek</a>. I was a **NLP Intern** at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/siri/">Apple Siri Cambridge</a> (Summer 2017) where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-voice-a67b9ab9/">Dr. Thomas Voice</a>.

    Recently, submodular functions are becoming increasingly important in machine learning (ML) for modelling notions such as
    information and redundancy among entities such as data and
    features. Among these applications, a key question is payoff allocation, i.e., how to evaluate the importance of each entity towards
    the collective objective? In particular, an important notion
    that arises in the emerging submodular applications is redundancy, which may occur from abundant
    data or malicious manipulations where an agent replicates its
    resource. In this project, I present a mathematical study of the robustness and properties of game-theoretic solution concepts (e.g., the Shapley value) against replication manipulation in
    submodular games. Moreover, the findings are empirically evaluated on an emerging submodular ML application, i.e., the ML
    data market.

**Siri Internship**
I successfully designed and developed an ML user simulator which can simulate the human behaviour and achieve multi-attribute goals by carrying out multi-turn dialogues.
